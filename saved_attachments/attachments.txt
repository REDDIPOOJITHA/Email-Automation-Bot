Saved Attachments Folder

This folder is used to store files that need to be sent as email attachments.

How to Use:
1. Manually place the files (PDFs, images, documents, spreadsheets, etc.) that need to be sent via email inside this folder.
2. Ensure files are properly named for easy identification.
3. Supported formats: `.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`, `.txt`, etc.
4. Do not delete this file. It serves as a placeholder to keep the folder visible in the repository.

Note:
- This folder is initially empty. You must manually add files before running the email automation script.
